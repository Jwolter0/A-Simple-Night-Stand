The table consists of one of the top pices and six of the legs.

The legs are glued together in pairs to make them thicker and then bolted to the top of the table.

Because this was one of the first things I made, I didn't include holes for the bolts in the top of the table or in the legs so the need to be drilled and the holes need to be countersunk. This could be easily done by the CNC now.

I gave my table three coats of polyurethane and it has been holding up well.
